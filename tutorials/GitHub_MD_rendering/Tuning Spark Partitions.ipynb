By having all relevant data in one place (node) we reduce the overhead of shuffling (need for serialization and network traffic). Understanding how Spark deals with partitions allow us to control the application parallelism (which leads to better cluster utilization - fewer costs). But keep in mind that partitioning will not be helpful in all applications. For example, if a given RDD is scanned only once, there is no point in partitioning it in advance.

Suppose after the aggregation, we are only down to 2 million rows of data. Now if we were to save it as is, a lot of the output partitions will be empty.

Thus if a stage consists of 200 task, that means in this stage, we are applying the computation across 200 partitions.
